# trapjs
Trap.js is a new language made by Baran Skistad! It's primary function is to make JavaScript  overall easier to understand,
and to not get into a 'Trap' while coding! Trap.js is an open-sourced function library. It isn't a real language, more like
Node.js.

# I Want to Help!
Great! We're glad you want to help! Simply make a Pull request with your added functions and we'll consider it! Please keep
in mind: we're looking for basic functions that aren't too complicated, so make it easy to understand! Another way you can
help is by helping with the issues! Afterall, issues need to be solved!

# How it Works
Well, that's why we have a Wiki! The wiki will give a definition of the function you're looking for and tell you how to
use it! We'll try to make a definition for all the functions, if we miss one, just make a new issue and we'll fix it!
